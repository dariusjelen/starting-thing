self-introduction to github
January seventh, 2018. This is my first time using github. I'm getting it setup now so that once I start programming regularly, I will have developed a nice portfolio and be able to arrange my work cohesively. Probably gonna be full of some junk but once I upload previous projects it'll be more populated.
